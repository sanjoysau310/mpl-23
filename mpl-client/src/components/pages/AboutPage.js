      Before starting we all need to know some rules,
      <ol>
        <li>Jiski Bat, Uski First Batting.</li>
        <li>Deewar ke uss taraf gaya toh out.</li>
        <li>Khadoos uncle ke ghar mein ball gayi toh out.</li>
        <li>Joh gutter mein shot marga woh ball layega.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        &emsp;This all started from a gully in a small locality of India,
        Katjunagar where some kids started playing cricket in the streets of
        their locality. They often had to change their destinations in that
        small locality as there was always someone who used to say{" "}
        <mark>"NIJER BARIR SHAMNE GIYE KHEL"</mark>.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        &emsp;The best moment for anyone who has played gully cricket was
        breaking someone's window glass while trying to hit a six and then
        running from there. Each and everyone used to run in different
        directions someone with a bat and someone with the ball. We all grew up
        from kids to teens and decided to organize a tournament just like 'IPL'
        in our gully and it was named RCL (Rising star cricket league) and from
        that day our journey started. As we grew up it wasn't possible for us to
        conduct that tournament in the gully because of those 'khadoos uncles'.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;Hence we shifted the tournament from the gully to Katjunagar
        playground where we ourselves made a pitch and organized this
        tournament, at first there were only 5 teams with 4 players, and
        nowadays there is always an overflow of players. last year we organized
        this tournament with 10 teams having 11 players each. Last year we also
        created our club named
        <strong>
          <mark> "MUSKETEERS CLUB" </mark>
        </strong>
        for organizing different sports events. And those kids who started the
        tournament are now the organizers of this huge tournament.
