      Before starting we all need to know some rules,
      <ol>
        <li>Jiski Bat, Uski First Batting.</li>
        <li>Deewar ke uss taraf gaya toh out.</li>
        <li>Khadoos uncle ke ghar mein ball gayi toh out.</li>
        <li>Joh gutter mein shot marga woh ball layega.</li>
      </ol>
      This all started from a gully in a small locality of India, Katjunagar
      where some kids started playing cricket in the streets of their locality.
      They often had to change their destinations in that small locality as
      there was always someone who used to say{" "}
      <mark>"NIJER BARIR SHAMNE GIYE KHEL"</mark>. The best moment for anyone
      who has played gully cricket was breaking someone's window glass while
      trying to hit a six and then running from there......each and everyone
      used to run in different directions someone with a bat and someone with
      the ball. We all grew up from kids to teens and decided to organize a
      tournament just like ' IPL ' in our gully and it was named RCL(Rising star
      cricket league) and from that day our journey started. As we grew up it
      wasn't possible for us to conduct that tournament in the gully because of
      those 'kharoos uncles'. hence we shifted the tournament from the gully to
      Katjunagar playground where we ourselves made a pitch and organized this
      tournament, at first there were only 5 teams with 4 players, and nowadays
      there is always an overflow of players. last year we organized this
      tournament with 10 teams having 11 players each. Last year we also created
      our club named "MUSKETEERS CLUB" for organizing different sports events.
      And those kids who started the tournament are now the organizers of this
      huge tournament.
